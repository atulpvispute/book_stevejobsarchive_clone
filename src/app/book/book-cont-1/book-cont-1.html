            Every great innovation starts with a simple question: "What if?"
          </p>
          <p>
            In the late 1970s, the personal computer was nothing more than a hobbyist's dream. 
            Most people couldn't imagine why anyone would need a computer at home. The prevailing 
            wisdom was that computers were massive machines meant for corporations and universities.
          </p>
          <p>
            But a small group of visionaries saw something different. They imagined a world where 
            computing power could be democratized, where creativity and productivity tools could 
            be placed in the hands of individuals.

            The 1980s and 1990s marked the golden age of user interface innovation.
          </p>
          <p>
            As personal computers became more accessible, the focus shifted from what computers 
            could do to how people could interact with them. The graphical user interface 
            revolution made computing intuitive and approachable for millions.
          </p>
          <p>
            This era saw the birth of desktop publishing, multimedia computing, and the early 
            seeds of what would become the internet revolution. Companies competed not just on 
            technical specifications, but on user experience and design elegance.

            The transition from desktop to mobile computing represented more than just a change 
            in form factor—it was a fundamental shift in how we interact with information and 
            each other.

            Suddenly, computing became truly personal. Devices that fit in your pocket could

            "Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower."

          <p>
            The journey of technological innovation is far from over. Each generation builds 
            upon the work of those who came before, pushing the boundaries of what's possible 
            and imagining new ways to improve the human experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we continue to advance, the most important question isn't what we can build, 
            but what we should build. Technology is a tool—it's up to us to wield it wisely.
