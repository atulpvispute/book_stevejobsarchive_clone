               <p id="sid-5">There’s lots of ways to be, as a person. And some people express their deep appreciation in different ways. But one of the ways that I&nbsp;believe people express their appreciation to the rest of humanity is to make something wonderful and put it out&nbsp;there.</p>
               <p id="sid-6">And you never meet the people. You never shake their hands. You never hear their story or tell yours. But somehow, in the act of making something with a great deal of care and love, something’s transmitted there. And it’s a way of expressing to the rest of our species our deep appreciation. So we need to be true to who we are and remember what’s really important to&nbsp;us.</p>

               <p id="sid-10">The best way to understand a person is to listen to that person directly. And the best way to understand Steve is to listen to what he said and wrote over the course of his life. His <span class="no-wrap">words—</span>in speeches, interviews, and <span class="no-wrap">emails—</span>offer a window into how he thought. And he was an exquisite&nbsp;thinker.</p>
               <p id="sid-11">Much of what’s in these pages reflects guiding themes of Steve’s life: his sense of the worlds that would emerge from marrying the arts and technology; his unbelievable rigor, which he imposed first and most strenuously on himself; his tenacity in pursuit of assembling and leading great teams; and perhaps, above all, his insights into what it means to be&nbsp;human.</p>
               <p id="sid-12">Steve once told a group of students, “You appear, have a chance to blaze in the sky, then you disappear.” He gave an extraordinary amount of thought to how best to use our fleeting time. He was compelled by the notion of being part of the arc of human existence, animated by the thought that <span class="no-wrap">he—</span>or that any of <span class="no-wrap">us—</span>might elevate or expedite human&nbsp;progress.</p>
               <p id="sid-13">It is hard enough to see what is already there, to gain a clear view. Steve’s gift was greater still: he saw clearly what was not there, what could be there, what had to be there. His mind was never a captive of reality. Quite the contrary: he imagined what reality lacked and set out to remedy it. His ideas were not arguments, but intuitions, born of a true inner freedom and an epic sense of&nbsp;possibility.</p>
               <p id="sid-14">In these pages, Steve drafts and refines. He stumbles, grows, and changes. But always, always, he retains that sense of possibility. I&nbsp;hope these selections ignite in you the understanding that drove him: that everything that makes up what we call life was made by people no smarter, no more capable, than we are; that our world is not <span class="no-wrap">fixed—</span>and so we can change it for the&nbsp;better.</p>
